The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.
BINDING ARBITRATION
Arbitration. For any dispute with NVIDIA, you agree to first contact us at by U.S. Mail at NVIDIA Corporation, ATTN: Legal, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California, 95051 and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that NVIDIA has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you within 60 days of your original informal claim (or sooner if, in NVIDIA’s opinion, a dispute is not likely to be resolved within 60 days), we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any NVIDIA claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these TERMS OF USE, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration before an arbitrator from Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) located in Santa Clara County, California under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com and will require you to pay an initial filing fee of $250.00 (unless you successfully apply for a waiver of this fee from JAMS). All other JAMS costs associated with the arbitration will be borne by the party that loses the arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California (or the nearest JAMS Office to Santa Clara County), unless you request an in-person hearing in your hometown or you and NVIDIA agree otherwise.

Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. If for any reason this agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to a dispute and as a result a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Santa Clara County, California.
